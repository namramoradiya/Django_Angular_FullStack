Full Stack Application - Built using Django as Backend and Angular as Frontend.

Application provides option of list and form . On click of form it provides the student form with fields - Name , Age, Department and gmail and on click of saving the from data it saves the data into the database.

Here I have used PostgreSQL as database. List displays the saved students fetched from the database.

Used Angular here in which created the services and 2 Component User-Form and User-list. Services includes the API Calling with the use of Observable.
